 Food Delivery Backend – Flask API
This repository contains the backend implementation of a food delivery system developed using Flask. It provides core functionalities such as user, rider, and restaurant registration, menu browsing, restaurant suggestions, order placement, and rider assignment, along with a command-line interface (CLI) for simulating API calls.

✅ Key Features
Modular Flask API: Clean separation of routes, services, and models.

SQLite Database: Lightweight schema ideal for prototyping.

CLI Tool: Interact with the API through a text-based interface.

Mock Location System: Location and ETA logic using named zones (e.g., "Downtown").

Core Functionalities:

User, Rider, and Restaurant registration

Menu management

Restaurant recommendations based on food type and delivery ETA

Order placement and total price calculation

Nearest rider assignment with availability check

Order history for users and riders

🗃️ Database Design
Users: user_id, name, location

Riders: rider_id, name, location, is_available

Restaurants: restaurant_id, name, location, food_type, prep_time

Menus: menu_id, restaurant_id, item_name, price

Orders: order_id, user_id, restaurant_id, rider_id, items, total_price, status, order_time

Mock distances between zones are stored in utils.py to simulate delivery time.

🧠 Business Logic
Restaurant Suggestions: Filters restaurants by food type and acceptable delivery time.

Rider Assignment: Picks the nearest available rider based on mock distance.

Order Processing: Handles validations, price calculations, and auto-rider assignment.

🔧 Development Principles
Modularity: Decoupled services and route handlers improve code maintainability.

Prototyping First: Text-based locations and mock logic are used to speed up development.

Extensible Design: Codebase is structured for easy upgrades (e.g., coupons, delivery tracking).

End-to-End Testing: CLI interface allows interaction without needing a frontend.

🚀 Future-Ready Improvements
To scale this system to millions of users:

📊 Database Upgrades
Switch to PostgreSQL

Add PostGIS for real-time distance and route calculations

Use partitioning and archival strategies for large datasets

⚡ Performance Boosters
Redis/Memcached for caching menus and order details

Load balancing with NGINX or HAProxy

Asynchronous tasks with Celery + RabbitMQ/Kafka

🌍 Real-World Geolocation
Use latitude/longitude instead of zones

Integrate Google Maps API or OpenStreetMap

Store rider locations in Redis for real-time updates

🔩 Deployment & Monitoring
Transition to a microservices architecture

Use Prometheus + Grafana for monitoring

Add centralized logging using ELK Stack

📦 Getting Started
1. Install Dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install flask
2. Run the App (CLI for Testing)
bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
Follow the prompts to register users, place orders, view menus, etc.

📬 API Highlights
POST /register_user

POST /register_rider

POST /register_restaurant

GET /menu/<restaurant_id>

POST /place_order

POST /suggest_restaurants

POST /assign_rider/<order_id>

GET /user/<user_id>/orders

GET /rider/<rider_id>/orders

🧪 Testing
The built-in CLI (in app.py) simulates user flow:

Register users and restaurants

Add menu items

Place orders

View order history

📌 Conclusion
This project demonstrates a full-cycle backend for a food delivery platform, focusing on clean architecture and readiness for production scale. While built with prototyping tools like SQLite and mock distances, it is structured for easy transition to real-world applications with advanced features.
